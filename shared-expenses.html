  <p>
    In a shared living situation, it can be hard to keep track of
    living expenses. A major complicating factor is that one roommate
    may reimburse another for some expense, and that money has to be
    taken into account.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I saw <a class="ulink" href="http://lpenz.github.com/articles/hedsl-sharedexpenses/index.html" target="_top">an
    article about this problem</a> a while back. The novelty of
    this solution is that rather than everybody throwing their money
    into a single big pot, the roommates who have debt pay the
    roommates with credit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s take the simplest interesting case. There are two roommates,
    Alice and Bob. They each spend $500 on rent. Alice then pays the
    electric bill for $200. The total outlay for this month is $1000 +
    $200 = $1200. Alice has spent $700, Bob has spent $500. To make it
    fair, Bob has to pay Alice $100. After that transaction, Alice’s
    outlay is $600 and Bob’s is $600, and everything is fair.
  </p>

  <p>
    Working through this example suggests a procedure. We calculate
    the total amount everybody spent, then the expected contribution,
    then the difference for each roommate from the amount they spent
    and their expected contribution. The reconciliation process is
    simply matching up creditors with debtors. One senses that this
    process is probably fixed-point (assuming we can take arbitrary
    fractions of a dollar) since every credit must be matched by an
    equal amount of debt somewhere else.
  </p>

  <p>
    For some reason, this problem screams Prolog to me. Let’s walk
    through a Prolog solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a first step, let’s define some operators so we can make this
    into a <abbr class="acronym">DSL</abbr> or domain-specific language
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">:- op(400, xfx, spent).
:- op(400, xfy, gave).
:- op(300, xfx, to).

:- dynamic (spent)/2.
:- dynamic (gave)/2.
</pre>

  <p>
    By supplying these definitions, Prolog can now be used to
    represent the data directly:
</p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">?- X = dexter spent 5300.
true.

?- X = dexter gave 2000 to harry.
true.</pre>

  <p>
    Note that Prolog isn’t assigning any <span class="emphasis"><em>meaning</em></span>
    to this information. It’s no different from saying
    <code class="code">spent(dexter, 5300)</code> or <code class="code">gave(dexter, to(2000,
    harry))</code>. The second example there looks a little bad, but
    since we’re only ever going to use the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">transitive</span>”</span>
    version, and we’ll be pattern matching with it, it really doesn’t
    matter which values are in which positions in the actual
    intermediate representation. We’re concerned about aesthetics. In
    fact, let’s bring over the sample database so we can see them:
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">dexter spent 5300.
angel spent 2700.
debra spent 800.
harry spent 1900.
debra spent 1700.
angel spent 2200.

dexter gave 2000 to harry.
angel gave 3200 to debra.
</pre>

  <p>
    This is somewhat more attractive than the Haskell version, despite
    conveying the same information from within the syntactic
    constraints of the language. Let’s build on this by figuring out
    what everybody’s personal expenditures are, not taking into
    account <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">gifts</span>”</span>. Let’s just sum up the amount spent
    per person.
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">total_spent(Person, Total) :-
    bagof(Amount, Person spent Amount, Receipts),
    sum(Receipts, Total).
</pre>

  <p>Unfortunately, the predicate <code class="function">total_spent/2</code> references <code class="function">sum/2</code>, which isn’t in the standard library, but should be. We can add our own implementation:</p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">sum(List, Total) :- sum(List, 0, Total).

sum([], Total, Total).
sum([X|Xs], Acc, Total) :- Acc1 is Acc + X, sum(Xs, Acc1, Total).
</pre>

  <p>
    We can now see that <code class="function">total_spent/2</code> is going to
    generate all the people and the total they’ve spent:
  </p>

  <pre class="screen">?- total_spent(Person, Total).
Person = angel,
Total = 4900 ;

Person = debra,
Total = 2500 ;

Person = dexter,
Total = 5300 ;

Person = harry,
Total = 1900.</pre>

  <p>
    One major difference between Prolog and other programming
    languages is that predicates can be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">driven</span>”</span> in
    different ways. Different arguments can serve as input or output
    depending on the circumstances. The above predicate is written
    generally enough that it can actually generate the people as well
    as their totals. It’s desirable that predicates have this
    universality as much as possible. The more ways the predicate can
    be called, the freer we are in applying Prolog’s power to our
    problem.
  </p>

  <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Modes and Instantiation Patterns</strong></p></div></div></div>
    

    <p>
      Sometimes you will see Prolog predicates documented like so:
    </p>

    <pre class="screen">%!  total_spent(?Person:atom, ?Total:number) is nondet.</pre>

    <p>
      This is <a class="ulink" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section%282,%275%27,swi%28%27/doc/packages/pldoc.html%27%29%29" target="_top">PlDoc
      markup</a>. The objective with this markup is to convey what
      inputs and outputs are sensible, how many solutions you’re
      likely to get, and which variable/ground term arrangements can
      be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example, each argument is adorned with a <code class="code">?</code>
      which indicates that it can be a ground term or a variable, it
      doesn’t matter which. This means all of the following
      invocations are reasonable:
    </p>

    <pre class="screen">total_spent(Person, Amount).
total_spent(angel, Amount).
total_spent(Person, 1000).
total_spent(angel, 4900).</pre>

    <p>
      The <code class="code">?</code> could also be a <code class="code">+</code> or
      <code class="code">-</code>, to indicate that the argument must be supplied
      (i.e. a ground term) or must be a variable (non-ground term)
      respectively. This is called the <span class="emphasis"><em>instantiation
      pattern</em></span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code class="code">is nondet</code> part of the predicate documentation
      indicates how many solutions there will be, called the
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">determinism</span>”</span> of the predicate. In this case, the
      answer depends on which arguments are instantiated. If either
      the first or the second argument is a ground term, it will
      either fail or succeed once; for instance,
      <code class="code">total_spent(angel, Amount)</code> will succeed unifying
      <code class="code">Amount</code> with 4900 because Angel spent $4900. On the
      other hand, <code class="code">total_spent(Person, 1000)</code> will fail
      because nobody spent exactly 1000; if we had specified 1900 it
      would have succeeded, unifying <code class="code">Person</code> with
      <code class="code">harry</code>. If both arguments are variables, we get a
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">generator,</span>”</span> meaning many solutions, which would
      have the determinism type of <code class="code">nondet</code> or
      <code class="code">multi</code> depending on whether one result is
      guaranteed. Finally, <code class="code">semidet</code> specifies that the
      predicate will either succeed once or fail, and
      <code class="code">failure</code> specifies that it will always fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      In practice, most of the time predicates will be
      <code class="code">det</code>, <code class="code">semidet</code> or <code class="code">nondet</code>,
      reflecting the reality that most of the time there is one
      solution (the predicate is basically a function) or we don’t
      know how many solutions there will be ahead of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      We could be more explicit with our documentation by specifying:
    </p>

    <pre class="screen">%!  total_spent(+Person:atom, +Total:number) is semidet.
%!  total_spent(+Person:atom, -Total:number) is semidet.    
%!  total_spent(-Person:atom, +Total:number) is semidet.
%!  total_spent(-Person:atom, -Total:number) is nondet.</pre>

    <p>
      These documentation comments are extremely handy when learning a
      new Prolog API, but we won’t spend too much time worrying about
      them in this program.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    We can now calculate the total outlay on top of
    <code class="function">total_spent/2</code> or on top of the raw
    <code class="function">spent/2</code> facts; either way, it doesn’t affect the
    outcome, just the amount of work that goes into producing it.
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">total_cost(Total) :-
    findall(Amount, _ spent Amount, Expenditures),
    sum(Expenditures, Total).
</pre>

  <pre class="screen">?- total_cost(X).
X = 14600.</pre>

  <p>
    We can now calculate the per-person expected contribution by
    dividing the total outlay by the number of people:
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">expected_contribution(X) :-
    total_cost(Total),
    setof(Person, A^(Person spent A), People),
    length(People, RoommateCount),
    X is Total / RoommateCount.
</pre>

  <p>
    I find it desirable for Prolog to suggest a natural English
    reading. Sometimes the logical reading doesn’t match particularly
    closely, because the natural language is insufficiently
    precise. The first line and the last two lines are quite sensible
    here. The second line, however, is a little more complex. I’m
    using the expenditures in the database to furnish me with a list
    of roommates. This isn’t especially robust, since we could have a
    roommate that only gifts other roommates and doesn’t actually
    spend anything himself (I think we’ve all met the type). We could
    even have unpaying roommates, like Fluffy, and we might want to
    calculate her share as a punitive measure against her owner. In
    either of these cases, a simple solution is to mandate that the
    user say, for instance, <code class="code">fluffy spent 0.</code>, but a more
    robust solution would be to either require a list of roommates or
    make a new predicate to capture <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">roommateness.</span>”</span> Let’s
    try that.
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">roommate(Roomie) :- Roomie spent _.
roommate(Roomie) :- Roomie gave _ to _.

expected_contribution(X) :-
    total_cost(Total),
    setof(Person, roommate(Person), People),
    length(People, RoommateCount),
    X is Total / RoommateCount.
</pre>

  <pre class="screen">?- expected_contribution(X).
X = 3650.</pre>

  <p>
    So, we’ve already calculated what everybody should have
    contributed and what everybody has already spent. Now we simply
    need to account for individual donations and then we can output
    who should pay what to whom.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two ways forward from here. Let’s examine them both. The
    first one is to use the database to store what we calculate. We
    could <code class="code">assertz(owes(Person, ExpectedContribution))</code> and
    then have one process to update that value, first with what
    they’ve spent, then with the result of applying their donations. A
    part of me balks at this because it means storing intermediate
    results in the fact database, which is not susceptible to
    backtracking and can therefore introduce errors in a way that our
    raw data cannot. (This is standard operating procedure in a
    forward-chaining reasoner like CLIPS, but that’s a topic for
    another day).
  </p>

  <p>
    A more classically Prolog approach would be to have a resolution
    process that pulls all the relevant data from the database and
    passes it along in lists recursively until all the outstanding
    transactions have been handled, and then forwards its final state
    to a process that displays the outcome. This strikes me as a
    cleaner approach, even though it necessitates using a list as a
    map (since Prolog doesn’t really have a map datastructure). We’ll
    gloss over this inefficiency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Odds are good if you’re new to Prolog and come from a procedural
    background, the first solution will sound better to you. If you
    come from a functional background the second solution will
    probably sound better to you. It would be interesting to know which
    one you like better after you see them both, but I’m just going to
    show the Prolog style.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, let’s say we’re going to gather up all the expenditures and all the donations and then just forward them on to some other predicate that will reconcile them into a coherent list of what each person has paid.
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">reconcile(Reconciliation) :-
    findall(X spent Amt, total_spent(X, Amt), Expenditures),
    findall(X gave Y to Z, X gave Y to Z, Donations),
    reconcile_all(Donations, Expenditures, Reconciliation).
</pre>

  <p>
    Let’s jump to the interesting part and handle what to do with a
    single donation. Intuitively, what we want to do is get the
    donation. Whoever did the giving, this decreases their debt, and
    whoever did the receiving, this increases theirs by the same
    amount.
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">reconcile(Donor gave Amt to Recipient,
          PreviousExpenditures,
          [Donor spent DonorAfter, Recipient spent RecipientAfter | WithoutEither]) :-
    select(Donor spent DonorBefore, PreviousExpenditures, WithoutDonor),
    select(Recipient spent RecipientBefore, WithoutDonor, WithoutEither),
    DonorAfter is DonorBefore + Amt,
    RecipientAfter is RecipientBefore - Amt.
</pre>

  <p>
    The only thing that makes this confusing is our use of
    <code class="function">select/3</code>. I mentioned briefly that we would
    run into a situation using this approach where we needed to use a
    list as a map. What <code class="function">select/3</code>&gt; does is remove
    an item from a list and give you back the list without that
    item. So in the preceding code, we used
    <code class="function">select/3</code>&gt; twice, once to remove the donor and
    once to remove the recipient. By using a chain from
    <code class="code">PreviousExpenditures</code> through
    <code class="code">WithoutDonor</code> to <code class="code">WithoutEither</code>, we’ve
    threaded the state of the map through this rule. And then, like
    many Prolog rules, the work done in the body is synthesized into
    an out param; we prepend the new Donor and Recipient values onto
    the <code class="code">WithoutEither</code> list, effectively updating the
    values for <code class="code">Donor</code> and <code class="code">Recipient</code> in the
    state variable.
  </p>

  <p>
    This now looks like a perfect candidate for a fold, so let’s go
    ahead and import the <code class="code">apply</code> library for SWI-Prolog and
    use <code class="function">foldl/4</code> to build
    <code class="function">reconcile_all/3</code>:
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">reconcile_all(Donations, Expenditures, Reconciliation) :-
    foldl(reconcile, Donations, Expenditures, Reconciliation).
</pre>

  <p>
    If we run what we have so far, we’ll get exactly where everybody
    stands in terms of what they’ve spent:
  </p>

  <pre class="screen">?- reconcile(X).
X = [angel spent 8100, debra spent -700, dexter spent 7300, harry spent -100].</pre>

  <p>
    There are two problems with these numbers. First, they do not yet
    include expected contributions, and two, some are negative. But,
    using this and the expected contribution from above, we can
    convert this into a list of who owes and who is owed. Then all the
    numbers will be positive, and their role will be determined by
    whether they are a debt or a credit rather than by their sign.
    This goes against what would be considered proper design in a
    procedural or object-oriented system, but it will actually be a
    benefit in Prolog because it will create pattern matching
    opportunities that would not exist with just a bare number. To
    make it attractive, let’s add some additional operators:
  </p>

<pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">:- op(400, xfx, owes).
:- op(400, xfx, is_owed).
:- op(400, xfy, gives).
</pre>
  
  <p>
    Now we can write a predicate to take the raw list of where people
    stand and compute people’s credit/debt status. I call this process
    <code class="function">balances/2</code>. To do this, we have to consider
    three cases.
  </p>

  <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
      <p>
        In the case where the person spent more than the expected
        contribution, that roommate is owed the difference.
      </p>
    
      <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">balances([Roommate spent Expenditure|Roommates], [Roommate is_owed Amount|Debts]) :-
    expected_contribution(Baseline),
    Expenditure &gt; Baseline,
    Amount is Expenditure - Baseline,
    balances(Roommates, Debts).
</pre>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>
        In the case where the person spent less than the expected
        contribution, they owe the difference:
      </p>

      <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">balances([Roommate spent Expenditure|Roommates], [Roommate owes Amount|Debts]) :-
    expected_contribution(Baseline),
    Baseline &gt; Expenditure,
    Amount is Baseline - Expenditure,
    balances(Roommates, Debts).
</pre>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>
        In the case where the person spent exactly the expected
        contribution, they can be omitted from further discussion;
        they are <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">square</span>”</span> as it were. This one detail
        prevents us from using a <code class="code">maplist/3</code> to deal with
        this, though we could conceivably use <code class="code">foldl/4</code>.
      </p>

      <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">balances([_ spent Baseline|Roommates], Debts) :-
    expected_contribution(Baseline),
    balances(Roommates, Debts).
</pre>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>
        And of course we need a base case for our recursion, the case
        where we’re out of people to consider.
      </p>

      <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">balances([], []).
</pre>
    </li></ol></div>

  <p>At this point, we can now take a look at what the final balances are:</p>

  <pre class="screen">?- reconcile(X), balances(X, Y).
X = [angel spent 8100, debra spent -700, dexter spent 7300, harry spent -100],
Y = [angel is_owed 4450, debra owes 4350, dexter is_owed 3650, harry owes 3750].</pre>

  <p>
    This looks pretty good! Let’s figure out the suggestions
    for complete reconciliation.
  </p>

  <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
      <p>
        First we have the base case: when there are no discrepancies,
        no further suggestions are required.
      </p>

      <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">resolution([], []).
</pre>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>
        The next case is a special one, where one person owes exactly
        what another person is owed. In that case, we generate the
        expected suggestion and then recur, having dealt with both
        roommates.
      </p>

      <p>
	Intuitively, it seems likely that this case will be triggered
	once at the end of each suggestion invocation.
      </p>
      
    <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">resolution(Situation, [Debtor gives Amount to Creditor|Suggestions]) :-
    select(Debtor owes Amount, Situation, WithoutDebtor),
    select(Creditor is_owed Amount, WithoutDebtor, WithoutCreditor),
    resolution(WithoutCreditor, Suggestions).

    </li><li class="listitem">

	but the some part of the debt will remain, so the creditor
	will be removed from the situation list but the debtor will be
	reinserted with a wly reduced debt.
      </p>
      
    <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">resolution(Situation, [Debtor gives Credit to Creditor|Suggestions]) :-

    Credit &gt; Debt,
    NewCredit is Credit - Debt,
    resolution([Creditor is_owed NewCredit|WithoutCreditor], Suggestions).
</pre>
    </li></ol></div>

  <p>
    The first version of the code is now basically complete. You
    can run it like so:
  </p>

  <pre class="screen">?- reconcile(X), balances(X, Y), resolution(Y, Z), write(Z), nl.
[debra gives 3650 to dexter,debra gives 700 to angel,harry gives 3750 to angel]
X = [angel spent 8100, debra spent -700, dexter spent 7300, harry spent -100],
Y = [angel is_owed 4450, debra owes 4350, dexter is_owed 3650, harry owes 3750],
Z = [debra gives 3650 to dexter, debra gives 700 to angel, harry gives 3750 to angel] ;
</pre>

  <p>
    You’ll notice now that you can get several solutions. This is an
    automatic result of using Prolog to solve this problem. All of the
    solutions are equivalent, in the sense that everybody with debt
    pays up to somebody and everybody with a credit is reimbursed. In
    fact several of the solutions are simply the same instructions
    reordered. This is normal and not undesirable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another thing to note is that we have arrived at a reasonably
    efficient solution (at least, for the case sizes we’re likely to
    actually address) without using any cuts. This is also
    desirable. The cut interferes with Prolog’s reasoning system. It’s
    much better to use logic to constraint Prolog’s behavior, and only
    use green cuts to help Prolog avoid unnecessary computations that
    are guaranteed to fail, without altering its behavior in any
    observable way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s package it up in a single convenient method:
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">solve(Solution) :-
    reconcile(Expenditures), 
    balances(Expenditures, Balances), 
    resolution(Balances, Solution).
</pre>

  <p>
    And in action, we see it still works:

    <p>
      If you read the original blog post, you were probably both
      impressed and somewhat miffed by the completely obtuse
      code. This plays nicely into what Paul Graham so memorably
      implied about Prolog, that a language can be high level, but if
      it isn’t terse why would it be worth knowing? Is it true that
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">it's all downhill after you write
      <code class="function">append/3</code></span>”</span>?
    </p>

    <p>
      I suppose since you’re here, you have some interest in
      Prolog. One of the main reasons for this discussion is because I
      want to instill in you, and perhaps the rest of the world, the
      idea that terseness is not necessarily the greatest end. Prolog
      is very seldom terse. But when written well, it is transparent
      and intuitive in ways that other languages simply never get to
      be. It can also be horrifyingly obtuse and confusing, and it can
      take a lot of unlearning to learn, but I contend that it is
      worth it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking at the code we just wrote, one way of looking at it is
      that it does in 20 or 50 lines what Haskell did in 10 or 20. And
      there’s something to be said about that. But the Haskell code is
      basically incomprehensible, whereas the Prolog code perfectly
      reflects what it is that we’re doing, matching up debtors to
      creditors and transferring money. Where the Haskell code
      started with a DSL and then went full-bore into Haskell-land,
      the Prolog code started with a DSL and then continued to use
      that DSL to code the solution. We wound up with the best of
      both, and a great deal of what could have made Applescript
      great: a well-defined representation that recalled the natural
      language version, and made it easier to reason about what we
      were up to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is Prolog right for every situation? No, of course not. But I
      think it’s right for a lot more than it gets given credit
      for. Maybe these attributes would not make it especially
      appropriate for programmers, but I do wonder if they might make
      it more appropriate for non-programmers, who are less fixated on
      performance and perfection, but could use a more malleable
      language that more directly represents their interests.
    </p>

  <p>
    Whenever input is involved in Prolog, it’s tempting to use a
    <span class="emphasis"><em>definite clause grammar</em></span> or
    <abbr class="acronym">DCG</abbr>. In this particular case it almost isn’t
    worth it, because the Prolog code is so close to what one would
    want for an input format it’s pretty meaningless to improve on
    it. But let’s anyway, for the thrill of it. We’ll start by
    including the <code class="code">dcg/basics</code> library.
  </p>
  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">:- use_module(library(dcg/basics)).
</pre>

  <p>
    We’re going to define a document as one or more entries, where
    each entry will be so-and-so spent some-such or so-and-so gave
    some-such to so-and-so. In other words, we’ll have a production
    for spending and a production for giving.
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">document([]) --&gt; [].
document([Entry|Entries]) --&gt; entry(Entry), blanks, document(Entries).

entry(Entry) --&gt; spent(Entry) ; gave(Entry).
</pre>

  <p>
    Now, spending is pretty straightforward; we’ll just match lines
    that look like <code class="code">Sally spent $1000</code>. We won’t be
    expecting a period, just a newline. And we can swallow the dollar
    sign, should there happen to be one, without worrying if there
    isn’t one.
  </p>
  
  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">
spent(Person spent Amount) --&gt; word(Person), whites, "spent", whites, currency(Amount).
</pre>

  <p>
    Giving isn’t too bad either, but since we have this opportunity,
    let’s handle both <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Sally gave 1000 to Jim</span>”</span> and
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Sally gave Jim 100.</span>”</span>
  </p>
    
  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">
gave(Donor gave Amount to Recipient) --&gt; 
    word(Donor), whites, 
    "gave", whites, 
    currency(Amount), whites, 
    "to", whites, 
    word(Recipient).
gave(Donor gave Amount to Recipient) --&gt; 
    word(Donor), whites, 
    "gave", whites, 
    word(Recipient), whites, 
    currency(Amount).
</pre>

  <p>
    The following are really simple productions, practically boilerplate
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">
nl --&gt; "\n".

currency(Amount) --&gt; "$", number(Amount).
currency(Amount) --&gt; number(Amount).
</pre>

  <p>
    The <code class="code">word//1</code> and <code class="code">chars//1</code> productions are
    borrowed from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.amzi.com/manuals/amzi/pro/ref_dcg.htm" target="_top">the
    Amzi Prolog User's Guide and Reference.</a>
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">
word(Word) --&gt; { var(Word), ! },
   chars(Chars), { atom_codes(Word, Chars) }.
word(Word) --&gt; { nonvar(Word) },
   { atom_codes(Word, Chars) }, chars(Chars).

chars([X|Y]) --&gt; char(X), chars(Y).
chars([]) --&gt; [].

char(X) --&gt; [X], { is_char(X) }.

is_char(X) :- X &gt;= 0'a, X =&lt; 0'z, !.
is_char(X) :- X &gt;= 0'A, X =&lt; 0'Z, !.
is_char(X) :- X &gt;= 0'0, X =&lt; 0'9, !.
is_char(0'_).

</pre>

  <p>
    Now we can make an example file with the same information as the
    original database. Save this file in
    <code class="code">shared-expenses.txt</code> and let’s try to parse it:
  </p>

  <pre class="screen">Dexter gave $2000 to Harry

Dexter spent $5300
Angel  spent $2700
Debra  spent $800
Harry  spent $1900
Debra  spent $1700
Angel  spent $2200

Angel  gave $3200 to Debra
</pre>

  <p>
    Testing this shows that it is working:
  </p>

  <pre class="screen">?- phrase_from_file(document(X), 'shared-expenses.txt').
X = ['Dexter' gave 2000 to 'Harry', 'Debra' spent 800, 'Harry' spent
1900, 'Debra' spent 1700, 'Angel' spent 2200, 'Angel' gave 3200 to
'Debra'].
</pre>

  <p>
    This is great, but we need to get these facts into the database somehow. A simple way is with <code class="code">forall/1</code>:
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">load_document(Document) :-
    forall(member(Fact, Document), assertz(Fact)).
  </pre>

  <p>
    Now let’s make a simple main function so we can call this from a script:
  </p>

  <pre class="programlisting sh_prolog">
main :-
  optparse:opt_arguments([], _, [File]),
  once(process_file(File)).

process_file(File) :-
  phrase_from_file(document(Document), File),
  load_document(Document),
  solve(Solution),
  write(Solution), nl.</pre>
